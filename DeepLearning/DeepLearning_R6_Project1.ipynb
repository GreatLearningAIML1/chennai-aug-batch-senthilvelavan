Bank data had 2 serial numbers which can be dropped as it does not seem to contribute to the prediction whether the customer will exit or not. The dataset also had 3 object datatypes, hence it was label encoded to convert to numerical values. Independant variables are formed with 11 datapoints. Dependant variable is formed with 1 datapoint. Dataset is split into train and test dataset for both independant and dependant variables.
